**Spring Web MVC Application without annotations**

Mr. XYZ has written a book on his favourite topic “Spring - Core”. 

He has written a number of more books and now is planning to develop a web site – an online book store, where he can publish all his books. 

The web site is very simple, a welcome page, a page listing all the books in his online book store and a page listing the table to content of a particular book selected by the end user.
